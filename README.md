# LeaveBank
Simple Application to track/manage leave requests and time off banks.  A learning project for a GIT newb
I intend to use this as a training project.  If any useable code manifests I will update this readme, but please don't assume this is useful at this time.  
I based it off a clone from https://github.com/lahwahleh/Time-Off.gitso I had somewhere to start
